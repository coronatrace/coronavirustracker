        \nYou may hear an occasional sound in the background - this is the app using ultrasound to
        detect nearby phones.</string>

    <!-- How it works -->
    <string name="how_it_works_title">How it Works</string>
    <string name="how_it_works_description">Covid Tracker keeps a list of everyone you\’ve come into
        contact with (less than 2m away), where they also have the app. Then, if one of these people
        reports symptoms, you’ll also be alerted to self-quarantine so that we can slow the spread
        together.
        \n
        \nEverything is anonymous, and no personal data (like your name) or GPS location data is ever
        recorded. Users will never be told where, when or by whom they have been infected.
        \n
        \nTechnically speaking, the app uses Bluetooth, Wifi and near-ultrasound audio for precise
        proximity detection. You may hear a very quiet sound every minute for 10 seconds - this is
        the near-ultrasound audio and we\'re working to make this even quieter.</string>
